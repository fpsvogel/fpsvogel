Have you ever woken up and realized that you're a teacher but you want to be a software developer? I did, and ever since June 2020 that's what I've been working toward.

I'm now learning Ruby on Rails with a dash of computer science. [Here is my study plan](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-ruby-and-cs). I'm studying and coding part-time while working full-time in tech support.

Want to get in touch? [Start a new discussion here](https://github.com/fpsvogel/fpsvogel/discussions) or [hit me up on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fpsvogel) and I'll respond shortly!
