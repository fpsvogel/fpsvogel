Have you ever woken up and realized that you're a teacher but you want to be a software developer? I did, and ever since summer 2020 that's what I've been working toward.

I'm now honing my Ruby on Rails skills, with a dash of computer science. [Here is my study plan.](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-ruby-and-cs) I'm studying and coding part-time while working full-time as a tech support manager.
