I'm a teacher-turned-developer, now working as a Rails developer for Sana Benefits.

My most popular project is my ["Learn Ruby" resource list](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-ruby). I also enjoy building tools for tracking my reading, as well as tinkering with [my site](https://fpsvogel.com) which I built with Bridgetown.
